Welcome to my first project! This app was designed as an interactive tool to explore and visualize data from the "penguins.csv" dataset. It offers users an interface where they can access filtered information about penguins based on species and island characteristics! 

You can select from dropdown options in the sidebar to filter the dataset by specific species and islands, allowing for dynamic interaction and exploration. The filtered results are then displayed, enabling users to discover more about the distribution of different penguin species.
